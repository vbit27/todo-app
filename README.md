# todo-app

A simple todo-app build with vanilla JavaScript, CSS and Webpack.
It doesn't work on mobile yet. 
[live demo!](https://vbit27.github.io/todo-app/)

Fixes:

1. Make it mobile responsive
2. Fix when refreshing the page after the last project is being deleted, the empty header remains visible
3. Reduce the CSS code for the pop-up windows
